i18n_tools
==========

Very simple rake tasks for finding missing and unused translations in Rails applications using the
I18n library.


Installation
============

  (sudo) gem install i18n_tools


Usage
=====

Include the following snippet into your Rakefile:

  begin
    require 'i18n_tools/tasks'
  rescue LoadError
  end

Now you can run the following tasks:

* LOCALE=xyz rake translations:missing -- detects missing translations from your project in locale xyz
  and outputs them to stdout in YAML format.
* LOCALE=xyz rake translations:unused -- detects translations in locale xyz that are not used by any of
  your code and outputs the translation keys.


Tweaking it
===========

By default, i18n_tools looks for controllers, helpers, models and views in the usual directories. If you
use non-standard file types (such as "app/mailers" or something like that), add the following to your
Rakefile:

  I18nTools::Scanner.file_types << "mailers"

Some files might contain parts that look like calls to the translation library, but actually aren't. To
exclude these files from the output, write them into the file .i18nignore in your RAILS_ROOT, as regular
expressions, one per line. Empty lines or lines starting with # are ignored.

There is something special about the "translations:unused" task. In its default configuration it might
report things that are actually used. To exclude these false positives, enter each key prefix to ignore
into the file .i18nignore_unused (omit the locale). For example, a good start is to use the following
key prefixes for your .i18nignore_unused:

  activerecord
  # if you use authlogic
  authlogic
  date.formats
  datetime
  number
  support.array
  time
